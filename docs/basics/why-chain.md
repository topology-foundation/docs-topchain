# Why Chain?

TODO:
- briefly explain DRP, pointing out its ephemerality
- explain Chain's function.

> Topchain is a Cosmos-SDK based blockchain that acts as a gateway for interested parties to observe the CRO events happening in the topology protocol without running their own topology protocol node. Topchain nodes stream the [hash graph vertices](https://docs.topology.gg/docs/Concepts/Protocol/Hash_Graphs) from the topology protocol related to the CROs specified in the user's "deal" that topchain nodes agree to serve in exchange for a fee.

> Topchain is purpose-built only for serving CRO data from the topology protocol and does NOT support general purpose compute like smart contracts.
